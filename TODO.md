### To Do

IF I leave a link in the app to K1 Apps homepage, it needs to be optimized for mobile devices. It looks how I want on PC but mobile looks kinda shitty.

Once the next update pushes out the new urls > delete the old pages. I already did this but make sure, and also delete olds after switch.
