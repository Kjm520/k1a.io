				<h2>About the App</h2>
				<p>
					Buy Later helps you curb impulse purchases and manage any 30-day countdown with a simple, distraction-free interface. Add items quickly, track when they become due, and review completed tasks—all without ads or subscriptions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each item gets a 30-day “cool-off” period. If you still want it after 30 days, you’re in the clear. You can also use Buy Later for any 30-day countdown—whether it’s a to-do list, habit tracker, or project deadline.
				</p>
				<h3>Features</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Minimalist user interface</li>
					<li>30-Day Cooldown: Items automatically move from Pending to Completed once the timer ends</li>
					<li>Quick Add: Tap “+” and type in under a second—no extra screens or settings</li>
					<li>See Completed: Celebrate or clear your wins in a dedicated tab</li>
					<li>Always Free: 100% ad-free, no sign-in, no subscriptions</li>
					<li>Offline-Only: All data lives on your device for maximum privacy</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Whether you’re budgeting, saving, or simply want to think twice before you buy, Buy Later gives you the space to make smarter spending decisions.

				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

					<dt>Where can I see completed items?</dt>
					<dd>Switch to the <em>Completed</em> tab to review all items whose countdown has finished.</dd>

					<dt>Can I customize the timer length?</dt>
