	Apple App Store
	Title: "Marketing URL"
	Description: A URL with marketing information about your app. This URL will be visible on the App Store.
	I have been unable to find where this is displayed on the App Store page, but that could be because I didn't provide it in the last push. We will add one and figure out where it goes for the next update.
