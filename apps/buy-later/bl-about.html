			<h1>About the App</h1>
			<p>
				<e>Buy Later</e> helps prevent impulse purchases in today's modern online
				shopping environment.
			</p>
			<p>
				Have you ever spontaneously bought something and then 3 days later
				realized you did not actually want or need it?<br />
			</p>

			<p>
				It can be easy to open an app and buy something in a minute or less.
				<e>Buy Later</e> is designed to create a buffer in that minute. The
				app provides a minimal, clean interface where you can list things you
				want as you think of them, and then once they make it through the
				fixed 30 day hold period, can be bought (if you still think its a good
				idea).
			</p>

					countdown has finished.
				</dd>

				<dt>Can I customize the timer length?</dt>
				<dd>
					- Buy Later uses a fixed 30-day period deliberately. This

				<dd>
					- All data is stored locally on your device. It is not accessible anywhere except on the device
