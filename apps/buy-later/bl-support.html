				<h2>About the App</h2>
				<p>
					Buy Later helps you curb impulse purchases and manage any 30-day countdown with a simple,
					distraction-free interface. Add items quickly, track when they become due, and review
					completed tasks—all without ads or subscriptions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each item gets a 30-day “cool-off” period. If you still want it after 30 days, you’re in
					the clear. You can also use Buy Later for any 30-day countdown—whether it’s a to-do list,
					habit tracker, or project deadline.
				</p>
				<h3>Features</h3>

				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
				<dl>
					<dt>How do I add a new item?</dt>
					<dd>
						Tap the <strong>+</strong> button on the Pending tab, enter your item, and hit Save.
						Your 30-day timer starts immediately.
					</dd>

					<dt>Where can I see completed items?</dt>
					<dd>
						Switch to the <em>Completed</em> tab to review all items whose countdown has finished.
					</dd>

					<dt>Can I customize the timer length?</dt>
					<dd>
						Currently Buy Later uses a fixed 30-day period deliberately. This creates a standard
						procedure that the app was designed around.
					</dd>

					<dt>Is my data private?</dt>
					<dd>
						Yes. All data is stored locally on your device. We don’t collect or share any personal
						information.
